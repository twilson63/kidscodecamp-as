# Introduction

We are going to create a magic eight ball game, this game will give the computer the chance to predict the future.

We will create a program that you ask a yes or no question to, and click a button, the program will then randomly select from 6 responses and display the answer on the screen, using animation to appear.

The first step will be to build the html form.
