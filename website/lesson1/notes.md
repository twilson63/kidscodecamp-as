# Introduction

Today we are going to get started working on building your first web page. The web page will consist of a profile of a super hero that you will create, provide a origin story and a list of super powers.

# What is a webpage?

But before we get started, can anyone tell me what a web page is?

A web page is a document that is published to the internet with an address that everyone can access. Lets talk about the internet and computers.

# What is the Internet?

The internet is a network of computers that spans the entire globe, have you ever done a google search? If so, you basically searched for web pages on the internet. Just like people can talk to each other over phones, computers can talk to each other, and let each other know what address they are at and what information they have. How do computers talk to each other?

# What is programming?

Programming is where humans or programmers provide instructions for computers to tell them how to talk. We call these instructions `programs`, so the act of creating instructions for computers is called programming. We be programming a web site.

# HTML

In order to give computers instructions we need to learn their languages, just like we have different languages for humans, computers have different languages for different purposes, for our project, we need to learn HTML. HTML stands for HyperText Markup Language and it is the tool that we will use to create our web site.

# Editor

We also need a way to input the instructions so that the computer can load them and present the web page to all of the computers on the internet. We use a tool called an editor, the editor can be used to write several different programming languages for the computer, today we will be writing HTML.

You can use any text editor you want, if you are unsure then I recommend you use http://v.nodejskids.com or http://e.nodejskids.com

Both allow you to publish your pages to the internet in an immutable way, one uses a visual like interface and the other uses a text interface.
